Sidebar. I was in the hospital and I was asked by my team doctors if I wouldn’t mind another team to come and observe me. I granted it because that’s the type of person that I am. I said that to say that this is my time for myself. I would preferred not to be around anyone who has authority over me.  I would love everybody to be there male and female because Yoga is an excellent thing I’m finding out. But seriously I really wanted this to be just for the ladies who were in DWI Court to bond. They say this is anonymous but of course not today because I’m the only one who is actually a client of DWI Court who was in there today. For me I’m not getting the full relaxation because people in authority over me are in my space.  One last example. I get a massage every Thursday. To better explain the way I feel would be like someone from the courts showing up in my room while I’m getting my massage.
