They had required meetings throughout the 12 months. Like many other women physicians, I had delayed childbearing until after my training. I was not eligible to enroll in these workshops because I would have missed too many sessions due to parental leave. This arbitrary systems unfairly disqualified other women I am sure. The institution should allow anyone to participate in the leadership programs, regardless of how long they have been faculty, or else open up the time limit to beyond 2 years. ","I think academic medicine has a real blind spot for gender inequity because so many women decide to opt out of academic positions due to their inflexibility, and therefore few women end up in leadership positions. The reality is that most faculty in my department are men with non working spouses, while most women are in a 2 working parent or single parent family. This creates an instant disparity for the women who almost always have to spend more time on family care than their male colleagues. I have never heard anyone mention this in a serious way, and yet I find this the elephant in the room when it comes to gender equity discussions. ",Yes,Complete

This is a systemic, cultural issue in American medicine that physicians impose on themselves (me included) and I feel that my patients expect of me. One of my biggest challenges is always being available to my patients, due to the seriousness of their illness and diagnosis, so I am often answering phone calls or responding to semi-urgent patient issues at dinner time, bedtime, etc. I have not found an effective solution for this that doesn't either leave my family disappointed or my patients. Even on maternity leave I continue to be involved in several of my patients' care... maintaining boundaries and protecting home time is very hard. I imagine this will not be such an issue when my kids are grown, but right now it is hard to feel like I am doing both things well. Another issue is childcare-- for example, when my childcare help (nanny) is sick or my kids or sick, my patient care must continue, but my clinical research/manuscript writing/etc falls to the wayside.

So I stayed until other attendings came back into town and subsequently was both invalidated in my abuse claim (oh it couldn't have been that bad, they said) and simultaneously  blamed for endangering my child by keeping her in the home during that time. I blame myself as well in this regard but feel like my hands were tied - at one point having to decide whether to help the patient who arrived at the end of the day with a basilar occlusion or go pick up my child from daycare so I wouldn't have to ask my spouse (who was in the post-abusive behavior honeymoon phase) for help. It's a horrible position to be in. I triaged like we are taught to do, figuring the patient was likely to die if I didn't but that if I worked fast maybe I could sufficiently placate my spouse before he got angry again.

The young faculty are not given enough time to pursue their academic career. Diminishing the role of academic neurologists to generating clinical revenues ignores their unique and important roles to create new knowledge, train the next generation of practitioners, and advance standards of care at the cutting edge of healthcare.

It is evident to me that female colleagues at the department have often gained significant recognition at the SOM, hospital, and national levels before obtaining the basic recognition from leadership in their department. A number of senior male members of the department have sustained leadership roles for inordinate amounts of time, receiving substantial funding, yet who are allowed to remain in those roles while few measurable contributions. Funding for women is given with demands of high volume deliverables. Broadly across the university, I have both been subject to and witnessed engendering comments, including about appearance, maintaining female roles adequately in the home, and with name calling. I have witnessed the use of the word ""unprofessional"" to describe women who disagree with the diagnostic or therapeutic plan of a powerful male colleague (even when the female carries the field expertise) and to describe women who have not seemingly displayed adequate deference when subjected to rude behavior from male colleagues. Explanations given of why the behaviors are described as ""unprofessional"" have included not being as ""pleasant"" as was expected of them. Regularly during meetings, males are called upon to provide their opinions and females who offer commentary are ignored. If a male colleague in a meeting disagrees with a female's commentary, a precluding statement in response includes a soliloquy on the number of years they have been in their position or at the institution and why their opinion therefore is more valid.

Also, academic settings being WRVU based- it is a major hindrance to doing effective teaching or research. It defeats the whole purpose of being in academia, if one is constantly chasing wRVU's, there is less scope of meaningful advancement in academia. Also, if we are having same wRVU target as our friend in private practice of the same specialty and rank, and they are making 100 K more than us, what is the purpose?  I feel I am more altruistic with my time for teaching/ patient care and other committee work/ professional development work, that my bank balance and my research career is suffering.

Hours need to be extended- end at 6pm.   Would like more time to finish notes and other needed tasks of the day before picking up children.    It is not clear how promotion affects compensation and if it is standard or not within a section, within a department, and across departments.  This leads some faculty to wonder if there are disparities between sections or gender without transparency.  With new roles/responsibilities and special accomplishments, there does not appear to be change in compensation either which is why promotion is a big focus.  There was a institutional change to our overall compensation which was different than our contracts and that was not well explained by hospital leadership.  (90/10 model to 80/20 model).  The incentives whether it's clinical productivity (RVUS), quality (readmission, mortality, patient experience), research productivity (publications/grants) change each year.  When incentives are not clear or change often, it becomes less motivating.     Another factor that impacts advancement is support staff in research, administrative, education, and clinical spaces.  It appears that the support needed continued to lower as more faculty and APPs are added to our department without a similar increase in support staff in these arenas.      Committee work can help career advancement, but without time allotment or compensation, it can potentially be something that impacts future success or leads to more burnout.  There may be a gender disparity in who is asked to take on certain uncompensated work in committees.","I wish there was more focus on faculty retention and development.  Seems most of the focus is drawing new faculty in, and less focus on maintaining the programs prior faculty have built, or compensating faculty for their increasing contributions (which will reward and motivate them).
